      <h2>The Blue Alliance</h2>
      <p>Founded in the fall of 2006, The Blue Alliance began as a website dedicated to providing everyone
      involved in the <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition (FRC) with scouting data and match videos.
      Since then, the project has grown to include developers from within the <em>FIRST</em> community from
      various teams all over the world. We continually strive to make The Blue Alliance an even more valuable
      resource for our users.  Other additions to The Blue Alliance include match prediction and analytics,
      hosting of CAD models, and The Blue Alliance Blog.</p>

      <p>Since 2022, The Blue Alliance has been a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. We rely on community donations
      to pay for hosting costs.</p>
