      <p>The Blue Alliances utilizes statistical analysis to try to predict
      event results.</p>
      <p>Predictions are just for fun! Don't like our predictions? Go out there
      and prove us wrong!</p>

      <h2>Match Predictions</h2>
      <p>Match result predictions attempts to estimate the mean and variance of
      a team's contribution to the alliance final score. Means are estimated by
      solving for the minimum mean squared error
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_mean_square_error">MMSE</a>)
      solution to the standard <a href="/opr">OPR</a> equations. Final match
      score is predicted by summing each team's mean contribution. The actual
      score is then compared to the predicted score to calculate a team's
      variance which is used to inform future predictions.</p>

      <h2>Event Ranking Predictions</h2>
      <p>Rankings are predicted using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank">Monte Carlo</a>
      method, where matches are simulated many times and the rankings are computed
      for each simulation. Due to the discrete nature of the method, some scenarios
      may never be simulated even though they may be possible.</p>
