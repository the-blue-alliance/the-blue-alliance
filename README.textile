The Blue Alliance is a FIRST Robotics tool to help teams scout for,
compete at, and relive competitions.

h2. Setup

1. Download Google App engine launcher (http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html)

2. Import project file into Google App Engine Launcher

3. Run!

4. Visit /admin/debug to set up your local development version with data

h2. Paver Commands

Paver is an easy way automate repetitive tasks. These tasks are stored in pavement.py. Download and install paver from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Paver/ or use easy_install to install it.

h3. Simple Commands

* paver clean - Deletes artifacts that the app creates that you don't need.

h2. LESS

The CSS files are compiled from LESS to ease in development. Use a program such as http://wearekiss.com/simpless that automatically compiles
the LESS files into CSS. Just drag static/css into SimpLESS, and whenever you edit and save a LESS file, the CSS will be compiled! Make sure 
"minify" is enabled in order to minimize the final CSS file size.

h2. Testing

Testing is implemented using a combination of unittest2 and the Google App Engine testbed framework. Test coverage is a work in progress, and focuses on maintaining datafeed integrity in the face of optimizations and changes to FIRST's data formats.

To run the tests:
python run_tests.py &lt;app_engine_sdk_path&gt;

On a Mac, /usr/local/google_appengine is the App Engine SDK path, so:
python run_tests.py /usr/local/google_appengine

h3. Fixing SSLCertificate Errors

You will get an SSLCertificate error due to differences in the implementation of the App Engine urlfetch and urlfetch_stub. To fix the error, find the file google/appengine/api/urlfetch_stub.py in your App Engine SDK and modify line 77 to be "_API_CALL_VALIDATE_CERTIFICATE_DEFAULT = False" instead of "True".

On a Mac, your App Engine SDK might live at /Applications/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleAppEngine-default.bundle/Contents/Resources/google_appengine
