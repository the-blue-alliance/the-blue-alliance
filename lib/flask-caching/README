# flask-caching

A forked version of [`flask-caching`](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-caching) which support dynamic cache timeouts.

The wheel is built from: https://github.com/phil-lopreiato/flask-caching/tree/dynamic-timeouts

And this can be removed once https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-caching/pull/296 is merged and releated
