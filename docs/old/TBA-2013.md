    - 2012-08-18 note: Twitter is changing how their API is accessed and limited. We'll see if/how this affects us when they release more information in a few weeks)
    - 2012-09-05 note: The new API only allows 15 requests per 15 minute window for any of the calls we would need to get tweets from @FRCFMS. GAE doesn't support persistent connections which is required for use with Twitter's streaming API. We need a way to get Tweets more frequently than once per minute. New API ref: ttps://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/overview

Brainstorm
----------
### Mobile
- Mobile growth up 130% y/y. Expect more growth.
- Mobile peaks during events
- How might we build amazing smartphone experiences at competitions?
    - My Team's dashboard
        - next match time, who's playing
        - results so far
        - hashtag search for #frc177
    - Peak in on other events, get a summary
    - Scouting at this competition, who's doing well, who do we pick?
    - Hashtag search - Instagram, Twitter, CD for events, encourage media posting -there_
- Rich bookmarks to home screens on Android, iOS

### Live Desktop
- Ustream(preferred)/JustinTV(preferred)/NASA links for every event
- Multi-event viewing experience with live features (ex: score updates, notification for followed teams, etc)
    - Can build off of MadStream code, integrate into TBA.
- Social media hashtag search for every event
- Chatrooms? Usually peak at like 100 people, not _huge_ opportunity

### Swag
- tshirts, stickers for laptops, stickers for robots
- how would we get swag in every FRC kit?
- swag store?

### Hashtags
- Why put "177" on bumper when could put "#frc177"?
- How do we make hashtags better?
- Can we work w FIRST marketing to get this announced @ kickoff?
- How can we get teams to put hashtags on their real shirts?
- Might we sell hashtag shirts just "#frc177"?

### YouTube
- On-site YT video submitter
- Can have add a video for this on Match pages w prepopulated search on YT
- Better YT admin tools, including building a reviewer type login thing
- Encourage YT vid upload on mobile web pages
- Hashtags compound here
