## Current
**chat**
* Opens the chat tab automatically.

**social**
* Same as above, except for social.

**layout=[0...5]**
* Changes the layout. Default = 2.

**view_[0...5]=[event_key]-[webcast_num]**
* Adds a webcast to a view. For example, to put the Buckeye Regional to view number 1, add `view_0=2013ohcl-1`.

## Future Additions/Changes
**chat=true**
* Needed to add `=` so that new JS code will handle it properly. Would also work with `chat=` but adding the `true` helps with readability. ~David Thomas 2013-03-18

**social=true**
* Same as above, except for social. ~David Thomas 2013-03-18
