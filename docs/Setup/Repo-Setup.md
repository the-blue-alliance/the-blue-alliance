# Repo Setup
A small amount of repo configuration can be done in order to streamline development. This step is optional as it is not required for working in The Blue Alliance repo, but it will be helpful for contributors that plan to do frequent work in the repo. This setup happens in your local environment, not in the development container.

## Install Dependencies
This optional tooling requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install.

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8+)
2. Install [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

If you have both a Python 2 and Python 3 interpreter on your machine, run the `pip3` command instead of `pip`. To confirm, run -
```
$ ls -l `which pip`
```
If the path is a `2.7(.X)` path, run `pip3` instead of `pip`. If the path is a `3.8(.X)` path, run `pip`.

### Globally Install
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### virtualenv install
[virtaulenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) can be used to keep these Python dependencies local to The Blue Alliance project.
```
$ pip install virtaulenv
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Pre-Commit Hook
Install the pre-commit hook to automatically run a series of checks before committing your code upstream. This will ensure that basic issues (linting, type checking, etc.) are fixed locally happen before committing your code upstream.
```
$ pre-commit install
```
In the case that you want to bypass the pre-commit hook when committing code, you can commit using the `â€”no-verify` flag
```
$ git commit -m "Bypasing pre-commit hook" --no-verify
```
