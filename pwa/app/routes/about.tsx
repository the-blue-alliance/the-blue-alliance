          <p>
            Founded in the fall of 2006, The Blue Alliance began as a website
            dedicated to providing everyone involved in the <em>FIRST</em>{' '}
            Robotics Competition (FRC) with scouting data and match videos.
            Since then, the project has grown to include developers from within
            the <em>FIRST</em>
            community from various teams all over the world. We continually
            strive to make The Blue Alliance an even more valuable resource for
            our users. Other additions to The Blue Alliance include match
            prediction and analytics, hosting of CAD models, and The Blue
            Alliance Blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2022, The Blue Alliance has been a 501(c)(3) non-profit
            organization. We rely on community donations to pay for hosting
            costs.
