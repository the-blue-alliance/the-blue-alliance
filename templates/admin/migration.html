<h1>Migration Utils</h1>
<p class="text-warning">Warning!</p>
<p class="text-warning">These are one-time use utilities that update a
large number of datastore entries. Don't run them if you don't know what they
do, and please disable your utilities once you are done with them.</p>

<h3>Update Event Types</h3>
<p>FIRST is inconsistent about how event types are defined. This is to fix
the event types of old entries in the datastore.</p>
