      <p>The Blue Alliances utilizes statistical analysis to try to predict
      event results.</p>
      <p>Predictions are just for fun! Don't like our predictions? Go out there
      and prove us wrong!</p>

      <h2>Match Predictions</h2>
      <p>Match result predictions use ixOPR, a slight variant of
      <a href="/opr">OPR</a>, to attempt to extrapolate the final match score
      based on a team's estimated point contribution to an alliance.</p>

      <h2>Event Ranking Predictions</h2>
      <p>Rankings are predicted using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank">Monte Carlo</a>
      method, where matches are simulated many times and the rankings are computed
      for each simulation. Due to the discrete nature of the method, some scenarios
      may never be simulated even though they may be possible.</p>
