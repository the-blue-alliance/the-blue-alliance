      <h2>The Blue Alliance</h2>
      <p>Founded in the fall of 2006, The Blue Alliance began as a website dedicated to providing everyone
      involved in the <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition (FRC) with scouting data and match videos.
      Since then, the project has grown to include developers from within the <em>FIRST</em> community from
      various teams all over the country. We continually strive to make The Blue Alliance an even more valuable
      resource for our users.</p>
